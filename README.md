# Image Classifier Project

An image classifier project involves creating an artificial intelligence model capable of categorizing images into predefined classes. This technology is widely used across diverse applications such as facial recognition, medical image analysis, and content filtering. 

## Key Components

- **Dataset:** A well-labeled dataset is crucial for training a robust image classifier.
  
- **Preprocessing:** Images often need preprocessing before being fed into the model. Common steps include resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

- **Model Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns in images.

- **Training:** The model learns to associate patterns and features with specific classes through iterative adjustments of parameters.

- **Validation:** The model is evaluated on a separate dataset to ensure generalization to new, unseen data.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning model hyperparameters can significantly impact performance.

- **Testing:** The final model is tested on an independent dataset to assess accuracy and performance.

- **Deployment:** Once satisfied with performance, the model can be deployed for real-world use.

Image classifier projects are prevalent in various domains, contributing to advancements in healthcare, security, and computer vision. With advancements in deep learning and powerful frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, building and deploying image classifiers has become more accessible for developers and researchers.

# Flower Recognition with Pre-trained Models

## Introduction

The Flower Recognition project is designed to create an image classifier capable of identifying various flower species from a dataset containing 102 flower categories. This project utilizes the power of pre-trained models, specifically VGG16 and VGG13, to streamline the development process by leveraging knowledge gained from extensive training on large-scale image datasets.
